Hello! My name is Josh Tollefson and I recently obtained my PhD in Earth & Planetary Science at UC Berkeley. My day-to-day research involved observing and modeling the atmosphere of our solar system gas giants. A lot of my work and spare time has revolved around maps of some sort - both from imaging objects in space and drawing fantasy worlds for D&D games. I am a huge tabletop/board game nerd, puzzle hunt & crossword enthusiast, tailgate & football fan, and amateur baker. 

I am currently looking for a job in data science where I hope to use my background in statistics, programming, and quantitative analysis to transition into a faster paced industry role. I also have several years of experience as a teacher and research mentor for high school and college-aged students, and my ideal position is one where I can combine my teaching and technical expertise to work on projects that empower education or improve customer experiences. Solving problems that have a direct human impact motivate me most. 

Thanks for checking out my page!
